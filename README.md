  <li><a href='https://myki.co/'>myki</a> <br />
    Myki is a Cyber Security company that is defining the future of digital identity; a future where proprietary data remains in the hands of the user and not the service provider. 
Cloud storage of passwords, keys and certificates is convenient but constitutes a big security issue. Hackers shouldn't be able to compromise a publicly accessible server and as a result gain access to users credentials. 
This is why with Myki we keep your data completely off the cloud. We strive to continuously provide the security of being Offline and the convenience of being cloud-connected.
